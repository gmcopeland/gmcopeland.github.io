This project started off very simple, and turned sour. It is simple yes, but it is functional and will be updated even more over time. It is a beginning. 

You may notice that the source files were added quite late. This is due to a previous issue with the .gitignore not including the build files when running
"npm run build" or "yarn build". Removing that limitation allowed me to finally add them to the master branch. After that was navigating a bad merge conflict before 
inevitably just "git push -f" as a hail mary to get the src files where they need to be.
